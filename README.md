This repository is still under development, files may change without warning.

For most snippets/themes in this repository, the Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enable.

I am primarily testing this on Vesktop (Vencord desktop app), but occasionally verify snippets with Vencord (modded Discord app via Vencord).
