This repository is still under development, files may change without warning.

I recommend using the Vencord ThemeAttributes plugin should be enabled as it may be necessary for some snippets/themes in this repository.

I am primarily testing this on Vesktop (Vencord desktop app), but occasionally verify snippets with Vencord (modded Discord app via Vencord).
