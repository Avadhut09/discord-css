| Snippet | Description | Preview |
| :-: | :--: | :--: |
| [BetterModView](BetterModView.css) | Give Discord's "mod view" its intended style. Works for users with and without profile themes. | ![image](https://github.com/tom22k/css-snippets/assets/143504320/abe67b48-305d-41ae-9861-f32f4378987b) ![image](https://github.com/tom22k/css-snippets/assets/143504320/e2e33416-a406-4dad-891c-c8b82627e6f0) |
| [BoxyUserPanel](BoxyUserPanel.css) | Just a user panel re-design, inspired by [Snare Hawk's idea](https://github.com/Snare-Hawk/snare-CSS?tab=readme-ov-file#profile-panel-thingy). Works with the game activity toggle button too. | ![image](https://github.com/tom22k/discord-css/assets/143504320/58bf65e2-e1b8-42fc-9ce7-d7f1a6158bdf) |
| [ClickableConnectedAccounts](ClickableConnectedAccounts.css) | Make each entire connected account clickable! Instead of just the little arrow. Also adds a little background when hovering. | ![gif](https://github.com/tom22k/css-snippets/assets/143504320/614f642c-4140-41dc-91c9-5fb7e551d43c) |
| [InteractiveFolders](InteractiveFolders.css) | A simple redesign making folders and the "Add a Server" button appear as interactive icons. | ![gif](https://github.com/tom22k/discord-css/assets/143504320/cf5be4a6-23a7-4085-936e-b2dfd8e28d63) |
| [RevealDarkUsernames](RevealDarkUsernames.css) | Be able to see dark usernames when hovering over them. | ![gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1c2ca6-e8a6-477c-99a0-d092c5784702) |
| [SimpleDarkUsernamesFix](SimpleDarkUsernamesFix.css) | Makes very dark usernames the normal text colour. This is applied to usernames everywhere, as well as places where the RoleColorEverywhere plugin would add role colors. | ![image](https://github.com/tom22k/discord-css/assets/143504320/5cf19078-7e08-4276-a89e-5aa5c5d5d26e) ![image](https://github.com/tom22k/discord-css/assets/143504320/851cef4f-b180-4a01-a26f-09aa9556d03c) |
