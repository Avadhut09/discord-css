# [Spotify Redesign](https://github.com/tom22k/discord-css/blob/main/Themes/SpotifyRedesignV2.css)
A redesign of the Spotify activities in user popouts and profiles, and of Vencord's SpotifyControls to match the actual Spotify UI.

**Note: This is a heavily tweaked version of DaBluLite's [SpotifyActivityRedesign](https://github.com/DaBluLite/css-snippets/tree/master/SpotifyActivityRedesign).**

# [HideNitroUpsellV2](https://github.com/tom22k/discord-css/blob/main/Themes/HideNitroUpsellV2.css)
Hide (or limit, where hiding is not possible) all the annoying Nitro upsell in Discord.
